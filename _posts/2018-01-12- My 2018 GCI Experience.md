2018 is the 2nd and final year of my participation in Google Code-in, an annual global competition held by Google for teens aged 13-17.

This 2 years were indeed eye-opening as it gave me an opportunity to step into the Tech World, having a taste of the different tasks- Outreaching, Coding, Researching etc.

For my final year, I hope to learn about new and upcoming software and technologies; and indeed, I did. Google Code-in liaises with several top-notch technology companies, providing me a platform to discover and learn more about these very companies and their communities. One such example is the JBoss Community.

JBoss Community is a community of open source projects, hosting projects of various programming languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP, Node, etc. As I have only started learning Python, I hope to branch out to various programming languages as time goes by. JBoss Community could serve as a great platform for my self-tutorial purposes.

All in all, I would highly recommend everyone- whether you have a tech background or not, to give GCI a go, then pick up skills and knowledge of different communities along the way! ðŸ˜Š
